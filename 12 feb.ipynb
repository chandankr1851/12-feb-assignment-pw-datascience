    "An Exception in Python is an event that disrupts the normal flow of a program's execution. \n",
    "When an error occurs during program execution, Python generates an Exception object, \n",
    "which contains information about the type of error and the location in the code where the error occurred. \n",
    "Exception handling allows programmers to handle these errors gracefully and take appropriate actions.\n",

    "Exceptions:\n",
    "\n",
    "Exceptions occur during the runtime of a program when something unexpected or erroneous happens.\n",
    "Examples of exceptions include ZeroDivisionError, ValueError, TypeError, etc.\n",
    "Exceptions can be handled using try-except blocks.\n",
    "Syntax Errors:\n",
    "\n",
    "Syntax errors occur during the parsing (compilation) of a program when the Python interpreter encounters invalid syntax.\n",
    "Syntax errors prevent the program from executing altogether.\n",
    "Examples of syntax errors include missing colons, incorrect indentation, missing parentheses, etc.\n",
    "Syntax errors need to be fixed before the program can be executed."
